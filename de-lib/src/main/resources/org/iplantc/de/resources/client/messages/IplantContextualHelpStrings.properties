collaboratorsHelp = <p>The Collaboration Window provides a quick way to find, add, and remove CyVerse users within your set of Collaborators or to create Teams.</p>\
  <p>Adding someone as your collaborator enhances the sharing feature, making it even easier to share resources with one, a few, or all of your collaborators. Data can be shared with individual collaborators, but not lists.</p>\
  <br><p><u>Collaborators</u></p>\
  <p>The Collaborators tab allows you to organize your own private set of Collaborators, which can be individual CyVerse users or lists of users.</p>\
  <p>To add a single Collaborator, begin typing their name or CyVerse username in the search field and a results drop-down will appear. Select the desired name to add them to your set of Collaborators. If you need to frequently share resources with several of the same Collaborators, you can create a Collaborator List. Click the "Add List" button to start creating your own custom lists of Collaborators.</p> \
  <p>You can easily access your set of Collaborators and Collaborator Lists when sharing data, apps, or tools.</p>\
  <br><p><u>Teams</u></p>\
  <p>Using the Teams tab allows you to create, organize, and join public or private groups of collaborators.</p>\
  <p>You can share apps or tools with Teams, but not data.</p>\
  <p>Any teams you are a member of will show up under "My Teams". Find other public teams that you can join by selecting "All Teams".</p>\
