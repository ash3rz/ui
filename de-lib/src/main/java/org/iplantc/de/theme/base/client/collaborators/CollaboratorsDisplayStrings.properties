retainPermissionsMessage=When items are shared with a collaborator list, those items are shared directly with the list and not the individuals within the list. \
  So deleting a member from a list normally results in those items no longer being shared with that member, and deleting the list entirely results in those items no longer being shared with anyone in that list. \
  You can, however, choose to delete a member or list and retain the permissions as they were.  Please choose an option below.
unableToAddMembers=Unable to add the following members: {0,list}
collaboratorsHelp=<p>Adding someone as your collaborator enhances the sharing feature, making it even easier to share resources with one, a few, or all of your collaborators. Data can be shared with individual collaborators, but not lists.</p>\
  <p>Here, you can organize your own private set of Collaborators, which can be individual CyVerse users or lists of users.</p>\
  <p>To add a single Collaborator, begin typing their name or CyVerse username in the search field and a results drop-down will appear. Select the desired name to add them to your set of Collaborators. If you need to frequently share resources with several of the same Collaborators, you can create a Collaborator List. Click the "Add List" button to start creating your own custom lists of Collaborators.</p> \
  <p>You can easily access your set of Collaborators and Collaborator Lists when sharing data, apps, or tools.</p>
